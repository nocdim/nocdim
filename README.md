- 👋 Hi, I’m @nocdim or nokkudimu
- 👀 I’m interested in working on web-applications, games and anything really :)
- 🌱 Right now I'm obsessed with the idea of using JavaScript to solve all the problems that internal 1C language can't!
- 💞️ Now I'm developing *useful* additional 1C Enterprise / Javascript applications, that make people's work a little bit easier :)
